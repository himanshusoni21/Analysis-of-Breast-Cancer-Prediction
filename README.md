# Analysis-of-Breast-Cancer-Prediction
In this Model, I have analyzed the dataset and ables to find out high multicolinearity between many features so I removed them unwanted feature and apply 3 machine learning algorithm to predict the cancer or not using Decision Tree, Random Forest ,K-Nearest Neighbor with 0.95 of accuracy.
To check whether diagnosis having M-Malignant and B-Benign
